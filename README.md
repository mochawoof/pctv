# PCTV
A simple IPTV viewer for Windows.

All the other Windows IPTV clients out there were either old or paid (or both!!) so I decided to create PCTV!

PCTV aims to...
- Have a simple, intuitive UI/UX
- Be reliable and stable
- Work well with any playlist file

Note: Up until release 1.0, you'll have to build the solution yourself to test PCTV.
